# Comprehensive Analysis of Data Augmentation Techniques Impacting YOLO and DETR Object Detectors

**Purpose:**  
The goal of this project is to systematically evaluate and compare a broad array of image‐augmentation techniques to quantify their impact on YOLO and DETR object‐detector performance, with the aim of identifying the most effective approaches for achieving robust, reliable detection in autonomous systems.
